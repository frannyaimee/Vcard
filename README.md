# Vcard

## Collaborators / Contributors:

* @frannyaimee Frances Renneboog

## Context:

This is a website where I created my Vcard template. It is very simple and has a basis layout page with a picture of me, with an opaque layer that has some information about me displayed in it. There is a navigation bar where I have made a home, contact, about, and skills button. This was an exercise given to me by the BeCode Coaches. This was one of the first exercises that we did in the course.

## Instructions
* Take a look at some inspiration
* Gather the information you're going to need for your VCard
* Make a new repo on GitHub called "VCard"
* Create your VCard in HTML and CSS
* Deploy it online on GitHub Pages

## Bonus
* Add a background image
* Add gradients instead of a color pallet
