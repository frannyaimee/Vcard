# Vcard
>This is a website where I created my Vcard template. It is very simple and has a basis layout page with a picture of me, with an opaque layer that has some information about me displayed in it. There is a navigation bar where I have made a home, contact, about, and skills button. This was an exercise given to me by the BeCode Coaches. This was one of the first exercises that we did in the course; I started and finished this March 1-5 2019

>This website is finished; I may reference back to it to use the code but I will not be adding code to it as of this moment (March 13th 2019)
This is a very basic html page with css styling.

>HTML example:
<div class="container">
	<a href="index.html"><img src="logo.png" alt="logo" class="logo"></a>
	<nav>
		<ul class="menu">
		  <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
		  <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
		  <li><a href="skills.html">Skills</a></li>
		  <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
		</ul>
	</nav>
</div>

>CSS Example:

body { 
  font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #222;
  background-image: url('me.jpeg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-position: center; 
}

p {
  color: white;
  text-align: center; 
}
.text {
  margin: 70px auto;
  max-width: 970px;
  background-color: #ffffff55;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  filter: alpha(opacity=60); 
}


>Installation:
>There is none. I used Sublime Text as my text editor and have written the code in HTML and CSS.
