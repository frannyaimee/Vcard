## Context:

This is a website where I created my Vcard template. It is very simple and has a basis layout page with a picture of me, with an opaque layer that has some information about me displayed in it. There is a navigation bar where I have made a home, contact, about, and skills button. This was an exercise given to me by the BeCode Coaches. This was one of the first exercises that we did in the course.
